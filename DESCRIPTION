Description: Multi Ornstein Uhlenbeck (OUM) models are routinely employed to 
    describe the phenotypic evolution of clades across a macroevolutionary adaptive 
    landscape. Multiple implementations exist, including those that require an a 
    priori assigment of lineages to adaptive regimes (e.g., OUwie), and those that 
    infer the location of such regimes shifts (e.g., SURFACE). However, SURFACE 
    has been found to favor overly complex models, which is likely a consequence 
    of fixing a single rate of evolution and force of attraction for the entire 
    tree. Although these parameters can be optimized for each regime by using the 
    SURFACE output as the set of regime shifts required by OUwie, such complex 
    models often fail to be optimized. extendedSurface provides a solution by
    continuing the backwards phase of SURFACE, merging regimes and generating 
    simpler (yet suboptimal) multiOU models. These are then fed to OUwie, where 
    parameters for each regime can be independetly optimized. Using simpler 
    OUM models as starting points improves the probability of successful model 
    fitting. The resulting models are more realistic, and have been found to be 
    favored over others using empirical comparative datasets. The package allows 
    the user to decide which models should be fit (OUMA, OUMV, OUMVA, with and 
    without stationary root state), and plots the fit of these against those 
    explored by SURFACE to easily compare model fit. Additionally, several 
    approaches to record and plot the evolutionary dynamics of discrete traits
    through time are also implemented.
